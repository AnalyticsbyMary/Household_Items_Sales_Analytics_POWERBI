![board](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/106894ed-d8d2-4af0-ab92-86fa040a34b9)

## Introduction
I undertook the challenge of creating impactful data visualizations to aid business decision making. My goal was simple to dig into the numbers and understand what truly drives revenue and customer behavior in an online retail business. Using Power BI, I built two connected dashboards: one that zooms in on sales performance, and another that uncovers customer insights and segmentation.

## About the Dataset

The dataset consists 
- 541,910 rows 
- 8 columns
  
An household item online retail store dataset with the following key columns
🔹InvoiceNo – Unique identifier for each transaction

🔹StockCode – Product identification number

🔹Description – Name of the product

🔹Quantity – Number of units purchased in a transaction

🔹InvoiceDate – Date and time of the purchase

🔹UnitPrice – Price per unit of the product

🔹CustomerID – Unique identifier for each customer

🔹Country – Country where the transaction occurred

## Questions to be Answered
For Sales Performance
1. How has revenue changed over time, and are there any noticeable trends or seasonal patterns?
2. Which products and countries contribute the most to overall revenue?
3. How do pricing and order quantities influence total sales performance?
5. What is the average order value, and which time periods or products show the highest performance?

For customer insights
1. What percentage of customers are repeat buyers, and how much revenue do they generate?
2. What is the customer retention rate and how does customer behavior trend over time?
3. What is the trend in daily order volumes (orders placed per day)?
4. What is the perfromance summary of the customers?

## Power BI Concepts Applied
   While working on this project, I utilized several Power BI features to create a dynamic and interactive dashboard.

🔹 Power Query – Cleaned and transformed raw transaction data for accurate analysis.

🔹 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Created custom measures for key metrics like total revenue, average order value, repeat purchase rate.

🔹 Interactive Filters & Slicers – Enabled drill-down analysis.

🔹 Time Intelligence Functions – Analyzed monthly revenue trends

🔹 Visualizations – Used bar charts, line charts, and KPI indicators to highlight top-performing products,e.t.c.

🔹 Geographical Insights – Mapped revenue distribution across different countries to identify strong and weak market regions.

## Findings
The dashboard gave the following insights
Sales Performance: The business has a strong revenue performance. 
- Generated a total revenue of $9M across 19K orders, selling 5 million items.
  
- Average Order Value is approximately $480.87, indicating high transaction sizes.
  
- Steady growth trend observed from January to November 2011, with a noticeable spike in September through November, followed by a decline in December.
  
- Products like Paper Craft, Regency Cakesta, and White Hanging Heart contribute the most to revenue. These are clear drivers of sales.
  
- UK has the strongest performance in terms revenue. Infact, 80% of the revenue is generated by customers from UK.
  
- There is a negative correlation between unit price and quantity sold. Lower-priced items are sold more.
  
Customer Insights: Repeat customers dominate, both in quantity and value of transactions.
- Out of 4,338 total customers, 2,845 are repeat customers, showing a retention rate of 65.58%.
  
- Repeat customers contribute 93.08% of total revenue ($8.3M), while one-time customers only contribute 6.92% ($0.62M). This shows that loyal customers are the main revenue drivers.

## Recommendations and Conclusions
Geographic Focus: Prioritize UK and launch geo-targeted campaigns and product localization where needed.
Customer Retention: Strengthen loyalty programs for repeat customers.
Capitalize on Peak Months and stock up on inventory for popular items.

This project provided has successfully provided valuable insights into both the sales performance and customer behavior of the business. From the analysis, it's clear that while revenue is strong, the major driving force behind it is repeat customers. This shows the importance of customer retention and highlights how loyal customers are contributing significantly to the business's success.
