## Introduction
As part of the Tata job simulation participant on Forage, I undertook the challenge of creating impactful data visualizations to aid business decision making. The business has been performing well and the management wants to analyse what the major contributing factors are to the revenue so they can strategically plan for the upcoming year.

## About the Dataset
An online retail store dataset which consists of 541,910 rows and 8 columns was provided for exploration. I
Key Columns:
ðŸ”¹InvoiceNo â€“ Unique identifier for each transaction

ðŸ”¹StockCode â€“ Product identification number

ðŸ”¹Description â€“ Name of the product

ðŸ”¹Quantity â€“ Number of units purchased in a transaction

ðŸ”¹InvoiceDate â€“ Date and time of the purchase

ðŸ”¹UnitPrice â€“ Price per unit of the product

ðŸ”¹CustomerID â€“ Unique identifier for each customer

ðŸ”¹Country â€“ Country where the transaction occurred

## Provided Questions for Leadership
For the Chief Executive Officer (CEO)
1. Which regions or customer segments contribute the most to total sales?
2. How does revenue fluctuate on a monthly basis, and which months experienced the highest growth or decline?
3. Which months contributed the most to total revenue, and do sales patterns indicate any seasonal trends?
4. Who are the highest-spending customers, and what percentage of total revenue do they contribute? Does the business rely heavily on a few key customers, or is revenue more evenly 
   distributed across a diverse customer base?

   For the Chief marketing Officer (CMO)
1. What proportion of customers place repeat orders, and do they tend to reorder the same products or try different ones?
2. How much time typically passes before repeat customers place their next order after receiving their previous one?
3. How much revenue comes from customers who have made multiple purchases?
4. Which customers have placed the most repeat orders, and what is their contribution to total revenue?

## Power BI Concepts Applied
   While working on this project, I utilized several Power BI features to create a dynamic and interactive dashboard.

ðŸ”¹ Power Query â€“ Cleaned and transformed raw transaction data for accurate analysis.

ðŸ”¹ Data Modeling â€“ Established relationships between different fields to enable insightful visualizations.

ðŸ”¹ DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) â€“ Created custom measures for key metrics like total revenue, average order value, repeat purchase rate.

ðŸ”¹ Interactive Filters & Slicers â€“ Enabled drill-down analysis.

ðŸ”¹ Time Intelligence Functions â€“ Analyzed monthly revenue trends, seasonality in sales, and year-over-year growth.

ðŸ”¹ Visualizations â€“ Used bar charts, line charts, and KPI indicators to highlight top-performing products,e.t.c.

ðŸ”¹ Geographical Insights â€“ Mapped revenue distribution across different countries to identify strong and weak market regions.
